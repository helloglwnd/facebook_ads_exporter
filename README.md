## Facebook ads tool
The repository to host work on exploring Facebook Business API 
This is a training project. I'd like to answer the question "How I can automate the work with Facebook Business API marketing team usually do" with my research. The goal of this exercise is to build efficient automation for routine tasks normally performed by marketing teams in Facebook Business and expecially Facebook ads interfaces. 


##Setup
